    description: 'I decided to undertake this path in January 2024. Programming languages and, more in general, informatics have always interested me from many points of view, such as being able to build your own application for business purposes or just for fun. Since January 2024, I\'ve been studying web development for work purposes. It was a very hard endeavor to pursue, and throughout my learning journey, I have faced several issues that I have overcome, all due to my perseverance and relying on many very good information sources broadly renowed by the whole web developers\' community, such as MDN Web, w3Schools and frameworks, libraries, and runtime docs (the useful ones, in my opinion). Although I\'ve used many other tools through my learning journey, I have to say that these formal information sources have enhanced my skills as well as my overall knowledge in terms of web development, as no other one has. I\'m thrilling to start working in this very fascinating new world. Let\'s code together.',

I was in charge as the team coordinator, and my main responsibility was to weekly report the data about revenues and outcomes in terms of SSD per client retrieved to the client\'s account managers.
